# Panta Rakshak (‡∞™‡∞Ç‡∞ü ‡∞∞‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∑‡∞ï‡±ç) - AI Crop Doctor

**Panta Rakshak** is a full-stack web application designed to help farmers diagnose diseases in their potato crops simply by uploading a photo of a leaf. Built with a powerful machine learning backend and a user-friendly, multilingual frontend, this tool provides instant, actionable advice to protect crop health.

This project was built to be fast, reliable, and accessible, especially for users on mobile devices with potentially slow internet connections.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Utilizes a deep learning model (trained with TensorFlow) to accurately classify potato leaves as **Healthy**, infected with **Early Blight**, or infected with **Late Blight**.
* **Simple & Intuitive UI**: A clean, mobile-first interface built with React that makes it easy for anyone to upload an image and get a diagnosis.
* **Instant, Actionable Advice**: Provides clear, color-coded results and straightforward "What to Do Next" steps for each diagnosis.
* **Multilingual Support**: The interface includes support for **English**, **Telugu (‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å)**, and **Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä)** to ensure it is accessible to a wider audience of farmers.
* **Scalable Architecture**: The backend is containerized with Docker and deployed separately from the frontend, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow/Keras, Uvicorn
* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment**: Docker, Render (for the backend API), Vercel (for the frontend UI)

## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To run the entire application on your local machine, you need to have two servers running at the same time: the **backend API** and the **frontend UI**.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or newer
* Node.js and npm
* Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/lakshmanmandapati/panta-rakshak-ai.git](https://github.com/lakshmanmandapati/panta-rakshak-ai.git)
cd panta-rakshak-ai
```
### Step 2: Set Up and Run the Backend API

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
    * *(Note: Your backend files are currently in the root directory. These instructions assume they remain there.)*

2.  **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    # Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Or on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    Your backend API is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. **Keep this terminal window open.**

### Step 3: Set Up and Run the Frontend UI

1.  **Open a NEW Terminal Window**: It's crucial to run the frontend in a separate terminal.

2.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
    ```bash
    # From the project's root folder
    cd UI
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your frontend application is now running, likely at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Step 4: Use the Application

Open your web browser and go to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). You can now upload an image and test the full application, which will connect to your local backend API.
