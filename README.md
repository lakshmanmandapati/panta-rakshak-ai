# Panta Rakshak (‡∞™‡∞Ç‡∞ü ‡∞∞‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∑‡∞ï‡±ç) - AI Crop Doctor

**Panta Rakshak** is a full-stack web application designed to help farmers diagnose diseases in their potato crops simply by uploading a photo of a leaf. Built with a powerful machine learning backend and a user-friendly, multilingual frontend, this tool provides instant, actionable advice to protect crop health.

This project was built to be fast, reliable, and accessible, especially for users on mobile devices with potentially slow internet connections.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Utilizes a deep learning model (trained with TensorFlow) to accurately classify potato leaves as **Healthy**, infected with **Early Blight**, or infected with **Late Blight**.
* **Simple & Intuitive UI**: A clean, mobile-first interface built with React that makes it easy for anyone to upload an image and get a diagnosis.
* **Instant, Actionable Advice**: Provides clear, color-coded results and straightforward "What to Do Next" steps for each diagnosis.
* **Multilingual Support**: The interface includes support for **English**, **Telugu (‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å)**, and **Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä)** to ensure it is accessible to a wider audience of farmers.
* **Scalable Architecture**: The backend is containerized with Docker and deployed separately from the frontend, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.
